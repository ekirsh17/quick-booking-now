Responsive testing: Test on a range of devices and browsers to ensure layout adapts smoothly and remains usable.\n4. Accessibility audit: Use tools (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) and manual keyboard navigation to confirm compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n5. Design system compliance: Review with design team to ensure cards, spacing, and typography match NotifyMe patterns.\n6.
