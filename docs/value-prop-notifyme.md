# NotifyMe Value Proposition

## Core Value Proposition

### Primary Message: "Turn cancellations into revenue"

When a client cancels, that slot doesn't have to stay empty. NotifyMe instantly texts customers on your waitlist, letting them grab the opening. Like how Resy Notify fills restaurant tables the moment a reservation opens up, NotifyMe fills your schedule automatically.

### Secondary Message: "Keep your schedule full"

Every open slot is potential revenue walking out the door. NotifyMe maximizes your utilization by alerting interested customers the moment availability appears — similar to how Booksy helps salons and barbershops stay booked solid.

## Key Differentiator: SMS-First, Zero Friction

**NotifyMe is not another booking system.** It's a lightweight layer that works alongside whatever you already use.

### How It Works

Merchants can manage openings entirely via SMS — no need to open an app:

| Text Message | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| `"add 2pm"` | Creates a 2pm opening |
| `"my 2pm cancelled"` | AI understands and marks the 2pm slot as available |
| `"opening at 3:30 for 45 min"` | Creates a specific 45-minute opening at 3:30pm |
| `"cancel my 4pm"` | Removes the 4pm opening |

The AI parses natural language, so merchants text like they'd text a colleague. NotifyMe handles the rest:

1. **Parses the message** — AI understands intent and time
2. **Updates the schedule** — Creates or modifies the opening
3. **Notifies customers** — Texts waitlisted clients about availability
4. **Lets them claim** — Customers tap a link to book instantly

### Why This Matters

- **No app switching** — Manage openings from your pocket
- **No learning curve** — Text naturally, AI figures it out
- **No extra software** — Works with your existing booking system
- **Instant results** — Openings filled while you're still with clients

## Target Merchant Profile

- Experiences regular cancellations or no-shows
- Wants to fill gaps without manual outreach
- Prefers simple tools over complex software
- Already has a booking system (or uses pen & paper)

## What NotifyMe Is NOT

- ❌ A full booking/POS system
- ❌ A replacement for your calendar
- ❌ A CRM or marketing automation suite
- ❌ Something that requires daily app usage

**NotifyMe is a single-purpose tool:** notify customers about openings so you don't lose revenue.
